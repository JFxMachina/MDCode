**Procedure for Risk Analysis**

Risk analysis involves examining how project outcomes and objectives
might change due to the impact of the risk event.

Once the risks are identified, they are analysed to identify the
qualitative and quantitative impact of the risk on the project so that
appropriate steps can be taken to mitigate them.

Identification of risk categories:

================== ==================================================
Risk Category      
================== ==================================================
Technical          Requirements, Technology, Performance, Quality
External           Customer or Contract
Organizational     Project dependencies, Resources, Budget, Logistics
Project Management Planning, Schedule, Estimation, Communication
================== ==================================================

**1. Risk exposure matrix**

A. Probability of risk occurrence:

-  High probability (80%<x<100%)

-  Medium-high probability (80%<x<100%)

-  Medium-low probability (30%<x<60%)

-  Low probability (0%<x<30%)

B. Risk Impact:

1. High – Catastrophic (Rating A –100)

2. Medium – Catastrophic (Rating B –50)

3. Low - Marginal (Rating C –10)

Accordingly, the risk exposure matrix is determined by multiplying
impact rating with the discrete probabilities:

The team decides at the beginning of each Individual sprint, which
events have a higher probability of risk occurrence and depending on
their category in the impact classification table, they’re assigned a
spot in the risk exposure matrix. Events with a higher score in the risk
exposure matrix demand an expedited response from the team. Hence, early
identification of such events is necessary.

**2. Risk response**

The risk response plan in this project is multi-layered. On
identification of the risk at the start of each phase, the team would
determine the exposure score by assigning probabilities to individual
events and then take an action according to the list below, always
trying to execute the first action possible.

a. Eliminate the risk

b. Lower the probability of risk occurrence

c. Lower the impact of the risk on project objectives

**3. Risk triggers**

Each development phase has many common tasks, it is therefore possible
to identify risk triggers before the start of the next phase. On
identification of such triggers, the team can circumvent these risks by
changing the appropriate parameters.

**4. Risk Audit**

It is also recommended to perform a risk audit at the end of the first
two phases to determine the team’s effectiveness in identifying risks
and classifying risk exposure.

**5. Risk Ownership**

The responsibility for managing all risks in the project lies with the
entire team.
