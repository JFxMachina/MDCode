=================================
Group contract: CSEP 2021 Group 1
=================================

The present group members have agreed that the goal is to learn about
collaborative software development and not to programming or molecular
dynamics. A working product should be delivered; however, the group does
not aim for it to be the best product possible.

Furthermore, the group members will aim to inform the project leader (or
other meeting organizers) about their availabilities in a timely manner.

The group subscribes to the philosophy, that in case rules are regularly
broken, the rules might be wrong. Therefore, the group reserves the
right to change said rules if necessary.
